## Aknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Altuna Akalin for his support and
guidance throughout this thesis, as well as for the generous amounts of
computation capacity I could access for the thesis. I also extend my thanks to
Prof. Dr. Zoran Nikoloski for agreeing to review this work. I want to thank the
members of the Akalin lab for making the long commute to Berlin worth it, and
for providing important suggestions when I was stuck on particularly annoying
problems and dispelling doubts about my work. I also wish to thank my friends
for keeping me sane through the darker parts of my journey. Finally, I want to
thank my family very much for supporting me through all these years of study,
both financially and emotionally. I could not have gotten here without any of
them.

\- Jonas
