# Discussion

## Proof of concept

### Normally distributed simulation

### scRNA-seq pseudo-bulks

## Evaluation

### Comparison to BayesPrism

* BayesPrism variability due to lower number of actual transcripts used for cor
  computation.

### Prediction

<!-- TODO Check novelty of that. -->

* Important finding: Targeted marker selection significantly improves
  prediction.
* Lower performance on full bulk data due to lack of QC?

## Proof of concept

## Outlook

* Need to benchmark microarray expression purification techniques on bulk
  RNA-seq data.
* Possible deconvolution model improvements:
  * Penalizing zero predictions
  * Spillover correction
  * Bias fitted values to be lower than bulk expression -> Generally positive
    residuals, sanity check.
