## Introduction

* A lot of bulk expression data around
* Contains an unknown fraction of non-cancer expression
* If cancer expression and microenvironment expression could be separated,
  that’d be good
* Characterization of bulk as linear combination of average cell type expression
  plus varying levels of noise, technical and biological → Let’s do linear
  deconvolution!

## Materials / Methods

### Data

* sc RNA-seq: Dataset by @Wu.2021
  * [Dimensions, expand on tumor samples]
* Clinical data: Using all available BRCA project data from TCGA (ver. 1.30.4
  INCLUDE `MANIFEST.txt`)
  * Retrieved via `TCGA-biolinks` [@Colaprico.2016; @Mounir.2019]
  * Using STAR count data
    * Using sums of counts per `gene_name`!
    * Raw counts, FPKM (upper-quartile norm'd)
    * Optionally log + scaled
* Survival data: TCGA-BRCA derived survival endpoints from @Liu.2018

### Random simulation

### scRNA-seq based simulation

* Normalizing the reference and bulk probably not necessary for `nnls`
  * See @Cobos.2023 Fig. 3.

Deconvolution inputs:

* Reference
  * Averaging of cell expression belonging to one cell type
  * Using raw count matrix [Why?]
  * Marker selection [Expand on purpose of marker selection]
    * Using wilcox test
      * via Seurat (v5.0.1) [@Hao.2023]
      * using `Presto` implementation [@IlyaKorsunsky.]
      * previous normalization via `NormalizeData`, method relative counts
        (`RC`)
      * Using bonferroni method for p-value adjustment
      * Cutoff: Adjusted p-value under 0.05
    * Outlier distance (similar to Hampel filter)
      * Gene is defined as a marker for a cell type if its expression is more
        than three median absolute deviations away from the median _average_
        expression (i.e. this runs on the reference matrix)
      * No scaling constant (We can't assume normality, this is just arbitrary)
    * Using random genes as markers
      * Cutoff: None, at threshold 1 all genes are used.

* Pseudobulk
  * Summing up all transcripts of a tumor sample
  * Using log-normed counts (via `scuttle::logNormCounts` [@McCarthy.2017])

Deconvolution:

* Using nnls [@KatharineM.Mullen.2023] (Simple)
* _Always_ using only marker genes to estimate cell type abundances
* Transcript predictions computed (Deconvoluted cell type abundance $*$ _full_
  reference matrix) $\rightarrow$ Getting transcript predictions for _all_ genes.
* Residuals computed as pseudobulk expression - transcript predictions
  * absolute values (they are supposed to be a measure for bulk expression, and
    so can’t be negative. It’s about the deviation, the sign is not relevant)

$\rightarrow$ Resulting data is available for all genes by default, but can be subset
to only markers.

Analysis:

* Correlations computed
  * cancer expr vs. residuals: This is the main thing we are interested in, it
    represents the degree to which residuals may be used as a surrogate for
    actual cancer expression. The higher, the better.
  * bulk expr vs. cancer expr: Used as a baseline to contextualize other
    results. If this correlation is high, and the correlation of bulk expr. to
    residuals is high, it would also follow that the correlation of cancer expr.
    with residuals is high, but just by definition, not by virtue of the method.
  * bulk expr vs. residuals: If this is high, it hints at problems with
    deconvolution. Generally deconvolution residuals should not be correlated
    with input data. Expected to be higher for reference missing the cancer
    signature.
  * All correlates log transformed
  [Kendall v Pearson]

### Verification

#### Prediction of an intrinsic categorical variable

* PAM50 subtype
* Performing same deconvolution procedure as during pseudobulk simulation ->
  obtaining residuals as training data
* Model training
  * Using TCGA bulk data and residuals (derived from references including and
    not including cancer) as predictors
    * [Dimensions of training data]
    * Filtered to only include "Primary solid Tumor" samples
  * Doing repeated cross-validation (4-fold, 10 repeats, SMOTE up-sampling)
  * Pre-processing: Decorrelation via PCA, excluding zero variance genes
  * Training SVM, linear kernel
* Using model accuracy (percentage of correct predictions) to assess performance

#### Prediction of a clinical variable

* Progression free interval [Why?]
* Training random survival forests [@Ishwaran.2008; @H.Ishwaran.2020]
* Using same sample data as in previous section but filtered to fit survival
  data
  * Filtered to only include "Primary solid Tumor" samples
  * Using unique samples (Multiple tumor samples from the same patient are
    present in the TCGA data.)
* Tuning model for best out-of-sample error using fast survival forest fitting
  via sub-sampling.
  * Using 200 trees
* Using optimal parameters to fit a full model.
* Using reported Harrell's C to assess performance [@Schmid.2016].

## Results

### Random simulation

![metric_summary_plot](./cancer-cleaning-output/notebook/random_deconv_exploration_output/metric_summary_plot.png)  
*`r readLines("cancer-cleaning-output/notebook/random_deconv_exploration_output/metric_summary_plot_caption.txt")`*

### scRNA-seq based simulation

* Generally good correlation, but little difference between split and no split
* Correlation seems to be driven by inherent correlation between cell-type
  expression & bulk expression, with residuals generally following bulk
  expression patterns.

![pbulk_sim_metric_summary_plot_kendall](./cancer-cleaning-output/script_run/simulation/plots/deconv_summary/metric_summary_plot_kendall.png)
*`r readLines("cancer-cleaning-output/script_run/simulation/plots/deconv_summary/metric_summary_plot_kendall_caption.txt")`*

### Verification

* Sometimes residuals better, sometimes bulk better, generally ~70% accuracy.

## Discussion

### Random simulation

### scRNA-seq based simulation

* Issue of correlation between bulk expression & cancer expression
* Deconvolution residuals just replicate the association -> no difference in
  cancer splitting and therefore no improvement over using bulk RNA sequencing
  to be expected.

### Verification

### Outlook

* Might be sensible to try more advanced deconvolution approaches, i.e. SQUID
  [@Cobos.2023]
