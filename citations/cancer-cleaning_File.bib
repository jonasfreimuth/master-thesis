		  four main breast cancer classes when combining data from
		  five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular
		  heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53,

		  numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations
		  including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3,

		  Currently, a systematic approach is lacking to address

		  We have developed a statistical method for deconvolving

		  al., 2020). Early in tumor growth, a dynamic and reciprocal
		  relationship develops between cancer cells and components
		  of the tumor microenvironment that supports cancer cell
		  survival, local invasion and metastatic dissemination. To
		  overcome a hypoxic and acidic microenvironment, the tumor
		  microenvironment coordinates a program that promotes

		  investigating a wide range of biological and medical
		  questions. Statistical and computational methods are key
		  for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the
		  massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers.
		  We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for

		  Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.
		  
		  RESULTS
		  
		  We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are
		  significantly DE between two types of biological samples
		  and find that there are substantial differences in how the
		  test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE
		  results are affected by features of the sequencing
		  platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling
		  calibration method (with and without phi X control lane),
		  and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate
		  the impact of the read count normalization method on DE
		  results and show that the standard approach of scaling by
		  total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We
		  propose more general quantile-based normalization

  abstract	= {MOTIVATION
		  
		  The use of DNA microarrays has become quite popular in many
		  scientific and medical disciplines, such as in cancer
		  research. One common goal of these studies is to determine
		  which genes are differentially expressed between cancer and
		  healthy tissue, or more generally, between two experimental
		  conditions. A major complication in the molecular profiling
		  of tumors using gene expression data is that the data
		  represent a combination of tumor and normal cells. Much of
		  the methodology developed for assessing differential
		  expression with microarray data has assumed that tissue
		  samples are homogeneous.
		  
		  RESULTS
		  
		  In this paper, we outline a general framework for
		  determining differential expression in the presence of
		  mixed cell populations. We consider study designs in which
		  paired tissues and unpaired tissues are available. A
		  hierarchical mixture model is used for modeling the data; a
		  combination of methods of moments procedures and the
		  expectation-maximization algorithm are used to estimate the
		  model parameters. The finite-sample properties of the
		  methods are assessed in simulation studies; they are
		  applied to two microarray datasets from cancer studies.

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND
		  
		  Deconvolution analyses have been widely used to track
		  compositional alterations of cell types in gene expression
		  data. Although a large number of novel methods have been
		  developed, due to a lack of understanding of the effects of
		  modeling assumptions and tuning parameters, it is
		  challenging for researchers to select an optimal
		  deconvolution method suitable for the targeted biological
		  conditions.
		  
		  RESULTS
		  
		  To systematically reveal the pitfalls and challenges of
		  deconvolution analyses, we investigate the impact of
		  several technical and biological factors including
		  simulation model, quantification unit, component number,
		  weight matrix, and unknown content by constructing three
		  benchmarking frameworks. These frameworks cover comparative
		  analysis of 11 popular deconvolution methods under 1766
		  conditions.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS
		  
		  We provide new insights to researchers for future
		  application, standardization, and development of
		  deconvolution tools on RNA-seq data.},

		  Many believe that genomic data will enable us to better
		  predict the survival time of these patients, which will
		  lead to better, more personalized treatment options and
		  patient care. As standard survival prediction models have a
		  hard time coping with the high-dimensionality of such gene
		  expression data, many projects use some dimensionality
		  reduction techniques to overcome this hurdle. We introduce
		  a novel methodology, inspired by topic modeling from the
		  natural language domain, to derive expressive features from
		  the high-dimensional gene expression data. There, a
		  document is represented as a mixture over a relatively
		  small number of topics, where each topic corresponds to a
		  distribution over the words; here, to accommodate the
		  heterogeneity of a patient's cancer, we represent each
		  patient ($\approx$ document) as a mixture over
		  cancer-topics, where each cancer-topic is a mixture over
		  gene expression values ($\approx$ words). This required
		  some extensions to the standard LDA model-e.g., to
		  accommodate the real-valued expression values-leading to
		  our novel discretized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (dLDA)
		  procedure. After using this dLDA to learn these
		  cancer-topics, we can then express each patient as a
		  distribution over a small number of cancer-topics, then use
		  this low-dimensional {\textquotedbl}distribution
		  vector{\textquotedbl} as input to a learning
		  algorithm-here, we ran the recent survival prediction
		  algorithm, MTLR, on this representation of the cancer
		  dataset. We initially focus on the METABRIC dataset, which
		  describes each of n = 1,981 breast cancer patients using
		  the r = 49,576 gene expression values, from microarrays.
		  Our results show that our approach (dLDA followed by MTLR)
		  provides survival estimates that are more accurate than
		  standard models, in terms of the standard Concordance

		  {\textquotedbl}dLDA+MTLR{\textquotedbl} approach by running

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND
		  
		  Very few analytical approaches have been reported to
		  resolve the variability in microarray measurements stemming
		  from sample heterogeneity. For example, tissue samples used
		  in cancer studies are usually contaminated with the
		  surrounding or infiltrating cell types. This heterogeneity
		  in the sample preparation hinders further statistical
		  analysis, significantly so if different samples contain
		  different proportions of these cell types. Thus, sample
		  heterogeneity can result in the identification of
		  differentially expressed genes that may be unrelated to the
		  biological question being studied. Similarly, irrelevant
		  gene combinations can be discovered in the case of gene
		  expression based classification.
		  
		  RESULTS
		  
		  We propose a computational framework for removing the
		  effects of sample heterogeneity by
		  {\textquotedbl}microdissecting{\textquotedbl} microarray
		  data in silico. The computational method provides estimates
		  of the expression values of the pure (non-heterogeneous)
		  cell samples. The inversion of the sample heterogeneity can
		  be facilitated by providing accurate estimates of the
		  mixing percentages of different cell types in each
		  measurement. For those cases where no such information is
		  available, we develop an optimization-based method for
		  joint estimation of the mixing percentages and the
		  expression values of the pure cell samples. We also
		  consider the problem of selecting the correct number of
		  cell types.
		  
		  CONCLUSION
		  
		  The efficiency of the proposed methods is illustrated by
		  applying them to a carefully controlled cDNA microarray
		  data obtained from heterogeneous samples. The results
		  demonstrate that the methods are capable of reconstructing
		  both the sample and cell type specific expression values
		  from heterogeneous mixtures and that the mixing percentages
		  of different cell types can also be estimated. Furthermore,
		  a general purpose model selection method can be used to
		  select the correct number of cell types.},

		  Identifying cell types and their abundances and how these
		  evolve during tumor progression is critical to
		  understanding the mechanisms of metastasis and identifying
		  predictors of metastatic potential that can guide the
		  development of new diagnostics or therapeutics. Single-cell
		  RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been especially promising in
		  resolving heterogeneity of expression programs at the
		  single-cell level, but is not always feasible, e.g. for
		  large cohort studies or longitudinal analysis of archived
		  samples. In such cases, clonal subpopulations may still be
		  inferred via genomic deconvolution, but deconvolution
		  methods have limited ability to resolve fine clonal
		  structure and may require reference cell type profiles that
		  are missing or imprecise. Prior methods can eliminate the
		  need for reference profiles but show unstable performance
		  when few bulk samples are available.
		  
		  RESULTS
		  
		  In this work, we develop a new method using reference
		  scRNA-seq to interpret sample collections for which only
		  bulk RNA-seq is available for some samples, e.g. clonally
		  resolving archived primary tissues using scRNA-seq from
		  metastases. By integrating such information in a Quadratic
		  Programming framework, our method can recover more accurate
		  cell types and corresponding cell type abundances in bulk
		  samples. Application to a breast tumor bone metastases
		  dataset confirms the power of scRNA-seq data to improve
		  cell type inference and quantification in same-patient bulk
		  samples.

		  outcomes, are better described by explicitly accounting for
		  the timing of these events, as well as their probability.
		  As a result, in these cases, traditional classification or

		  Specifically, we identify two main issues: i) the C-index

  abstract	= {MOTIVATION
		  
		  Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used
		  to study gene expression at the level of individual cells.
		  However, preparing raw sequence data for further analysis
		  is not a straightforward process. Biases, artifacts and
		  other sources of unwanted variation are present in the
		  data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on
		  pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization.
		  
		  RESULTS
		  
		  We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to
		  facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control,
		  normalization and visualization of scRNA-seq data. The
		  package provides a convenient, flexible workflow to process
		  raw sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset
		  ready for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite
		  of plotting tools for single-cell data and a flexible data
		  structure that is compatible with existing tools and can be
		  used as infrastructure for future software development.
		  
		  AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION
		  
		  The open-source code, along with installation instructions,
		  vignettes and case studies, is available through

		  the amount of genomic data is massive and substantial
		  efforts and new tools are required to unveil the

		  (GDC) Data Portal is a platform that contains different
		  genomic studies including the ones from The Cancer Genome
		  Atlas (TCGA) and the Therapeutically Applicable Research to
		  Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiatives,
		  accounting for more than 40 tumor types originating from

		  accessible and adequately harmonized. Moreover, they have
		  the primary focus on the data storage in a unique place,
		  and they do not provide a comprehensive toolkit for
		  analyses and interpretation of the data. To fulfill this
		  urgent need, comprehensive but easily accessible

		  genomics datasets, exemplified here by the TARGET data.
		  Evidence has shown that accounting for tumor purity is
		  essential in the study of tumorigenesis, as these factors
		  promote confounding behavior regarding differential
		  expression analysis. With this in mind, we implemented
		  these filtering procedures in TCGAbiolinks. Moreover, a
		  limitation of some of the TCGA datasets is the
		  unavailability or paucity of corresponding normal samples.
		  We thus integrated into TCGAbiolinks the possibility to use
		  normal samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)

		  RESULTS
		  
		  The intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed
		  prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained
		  significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated
		  standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic

		  model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model
		  predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND
		  
		  For heterogeneous tissues, such as blood, measurements of
		  gene expression are confounded by relative proportions of
		  cell types involved. Conclusions have to rely on estimation
		  of gene expression signals for homogeneous cell
		  populations, e.g. by applying micro-dissection,
		  fluorescence activated cell sorting, or in-silico
		  deconfounding. We studied feasibility and validity of a
		  non-negative matrix decomposition algorithm using
		  experimental gene expression data for blood and sorted
		  cells from the same donor samples. Our objective was to
		  optimize the algorithm regarding detection of
		  differentially expressed genes and to enable its use for
		  classification in the difficult scenario of reversely
		  regulated genes. This would be of importance for the
		  identification of candidate biomarkers in heterogeneous
		  tissues.
		  
		  RESULTS
		  
		  Experimental data and simulation studies involving noise
		  parameters estimated from these data revealed that for
		  valid detection of differential gene expression, quantile
		  normalization and use of non-log data are optimal. We
		  demonstrate the feasibility of predicting proportions of
		  constituting cell types from gene expression data of single
		  samples, as a prerequisite for a deconfounding-based
		  classification approach.Classification cross-validation
		  errors with and without using deconfounding results are
		  reported as well as sample-size dependencies.
		  Implementation of the algorithm, simulation and analysis
		  scripts are available.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS
		  
		  The deconfounding algorithm without decorrelation using
		  quantile normalization on non-log data is proposed for
		  biomarkers that are difficult to detect, and for cases
		  where confounding by varying proportions of cell types is
		  the suspected reason. In this case, a deconfounding ranking
		  approach can be used as a powerful alternative to, or
		  complement of, other statistical learning approaches to
		  define candidate biomarkers for molecular diagnosis and
		  prediction in biomedicine, in realistically noisy
		  conditions and with moderate sample sizes.},

  abstract	= {Tumor microenvironment (TME) has been reported to exhibit
		  a crucial effect in lung cancer. Therefore, this study was
		  aimed to investigate the genes associated with TME and
		  develop a risk score to predict the overall survival (OS)
		  of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) based on these
		  genes. The immune and stromal scores were generated by the
		  ESTIMATE algorithm for LUAD patients in The Cancer Genome
		  Atlas (TCGA) database. Differentially expressed gene and
		  weighted gene co-expression network analyses were used to
		  derive immune- and stromal-related genes. The Least
		  Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-Cox
		  regression was applied for further selection and the
		  selected genes were inputted into stepwise regression to
		  develop TME-related risk score (TMErisk) which was further
		  validated in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets.
		  TMErisk-related biological phenotypes were analyzed in
		  function enrichment, tumor immune signature, and tumor
		  mutation signature. The patient's response to immunotherapy
		  was inferred by the tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion
		  (TIDE) score and immunophenoscore (IPS). According to our
		  results, TMErisk was developed based on SERPINE1, CX3CR1,
		  CD200R1, GBP1, IRF1, STAP1, LOX, and OR7E47P. Furthermore,
		  high TMErisk was identified as a poor factor for OS in TCGA
		  and GEO datasets, as well as in subgroup analysis with
		  different gender, smoking status, age, race, anatomic site,
		  therapies, and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages. Higher
		  TMErisk is also associated negatively with the abundance of
		  B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils,
		  macrophages, and other stromal or immune cells. Several
		  genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) family and
		  immune checkpoints were less expressed in the high-TMErisk
		  group. Mutations of 19 genes occurred more frequently in
		  the high-TMErisk group. These mutations may be associated
		  with TME change and indicate patients' response to
		  immunotherapy. According to our analyses, a lower TMErisk
		  score may indicate better response and OS outcome of
		  immunotherapy.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND
		  
		  Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women
		  with high heterogeneity. The heterogeneity of cancer cells
		  from different BC subtypes has not been thoroughly
		  characterized and there is still no valid biomarker for
		  predicting the prognosis of BC patients in clinical
		  practice.
		  
		  METHODS
		  
		  Cancer cells were identified by calculating single cell
		  copy number variation using the inferCNV algorithm. SCENIC
		  was utilized to infer gene regulatory networks. CellPhoneDB
		  software was used to analyze the intercellular
		  communications in different cell types. Survival analysis,
		  univariate Cox, least absolute shrinkage and selection
		  operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox analysis
		  were used to construct subtype specific prognostic models.
		  
		  RESULTS
		  
		  Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a higher
		  proportion of cancer cells than subtypes of HER2+ BC and
		  luminal BC, and the specifically upregulated genes of the
		  TNBC subtype are associated with antioxidant and chemical
		  stress resistance. Key transcription factors (TFs) of tumor
		  cells for three subtypes varied, and most of the TF-target
		  genes are specifically upregulated in corresponding BC
		  subtypes. The intercellular communications mediated by
		  different receptor-ligand pairs lead to an inflammatory
		  response with different degrees in the three BC subtypes.
		  We establish a prognostic model containing 10 genes (risk
		  genes: ATP6AP1, RNF139, BASP1, ESR1 and TSKU; protective
		  genes: RPL31, PAK1, STARD10, TFPI2 and SIAH2) for luminal
		  BC, seven genes (risk genes: ACTR6 and C2orf76; protective
		  genes: DIO2, DCXR, NDUFA8, SULT1A2 and AQP3) for HER2+ BC,
		  and seven genes (risk genes: HPGD, CDC42 and PGK1;
		  protective genes: SMYD3, LMO4, FABP7 and PRKRA) for TNBC.
		  Three prognostic models can distinguish high-risk patients
		  from low-risk patients and accurately predict patient
		  prognosis.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS
		  
		  Comparative analysis of the three BC subtypes based on
		  cancer cell heterogeneity in this study will be of great
		  clinical significance for the diagnosis, prognosis and
		  targeted therapy for BC patients.},
